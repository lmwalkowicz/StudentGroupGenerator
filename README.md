# StudentGroupGenerator
create random student groups of varying sizes

Input: a list of student names, one student per line

Program will shuffle the student list and create groups of varying sizes (individuals, pairs, or triplets). 

If you have student pictures, put them in the photodir directory (or modify the code to a directoy of your own choosing). You can then use the showStudents function to pop up their pictures along with the group names (this function is handy if your students don't know each others' names well yet, where a visual reference might help them find each other more quickly).
